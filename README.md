# Delux - Explore the world , One Bite at a Time

## Introduction

Delux is a website designed to help travelers and food enthusiasts discover the best dining spots around the world. The platform allows users to search for highly-rated restaurants based on location and cuisine, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. As the sole developer, I handled project management, backend development, frontend design, and API integration to bring this project to life.
